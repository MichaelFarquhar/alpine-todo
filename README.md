# Todo List - AlpineJs + Tailwindcss

> [Live Demo](https://github.com) (Github Pages)

---

A small project I created to learn [alpinejs](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). It seems to couple well with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) so it was a good time to experience that also.

Everything is done within a single html file. Both frameworks were loaded through a CDN.
